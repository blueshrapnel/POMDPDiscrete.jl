Relevant goal information measures the minimum information that needs to be processed about
the goal for a given level of performance.  Low relevant goal information results in the
agent utilising actions that are contribute to achieving multiple goals.  A high goal
relevant information means that actions specific to only a few goals will be used.
Following a policy that minimises goal relevant information means that the agent will
traverse pathways common to other goals.
